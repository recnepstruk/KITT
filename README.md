# KITT

Successfully reconstructed KITT through digital reanimation utilizing language parts 
from Javascript ES5, HTML5, CSS3, and Angular2, in order to continue the timeless legacy of Knight Rider.   
KITT is fully capable of verbal interaction based on a predetermined memory bank salvaged from his remains.
I don't think he was happy that I woke him up....

Languages used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Angular.
